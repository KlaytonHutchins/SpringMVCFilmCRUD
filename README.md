# Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

## Details
This website utilizes a database that contains films and actors (and lots of other data too). The user starts at the home page with three options;
search films by id, search films by keyword, and add a film. If they search by id, they are taken to a page with details about that film.
If they search by keyword, they are taken to a page with all films that match the keyword, with hyperlinks from each film to it's own page.
To add a film, there are text boxes available for the film details. Once they submit the form, they are taken to a page informing the user that the
film was added successfully. 

## What I Learned
We learned a lot about using a github repository with two people making changes and contributions, and trying to prevent merge conflicts.

## Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Git, MySQL, JDBC, MAMP
